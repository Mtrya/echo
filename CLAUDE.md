## Frontend Learning Path (Beginner Friendly)

### Level 1: Building Blocks (Day 1-2)

```vue
<!-- This is a Vue component - like a LEGO block -->
<template>
  <div class="question-box">
    <h2>{{ question.text }}</h2>
    <button @click="selectAnswer('A')">A</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
// This is like the brain of your LEGO block
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      question: { text: "What is 2+2?" }
    }
  },
  methods: {
    selectAnswer(answer) {
      console.log("You selected:", answer)
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

### Level 2: Making Things Interactive (Day 3-4)

```vue
<template>
  <div v-if="!timeUp">
    <p>Time left: {{ seconds }} seconds</p>
    <!-- This timer counts down like a kitchen timer -->
  </div>
  <div v-else>
    <p>Time's up!</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      seconds: 30,
      timeUp: false
    }
  },
  mounted() {
    // Start the timer when the component appears
    this.startTimer()
  },
  methods: {
    startTimer() {
      setInterval(() => {
        this.seconds--
        if (this.seconds <= 0) {
          this.timeUp = true
        }
      }, 1000)
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

## Frontend-Backend Communication

### Simple API Call (Explained Simply)

```javascript
// This is like sending a letter to the backend
async function getQuestion() {
  try {
    // Send request to backend
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/question')
    
    // Open the letter to see what's inside
    const data = await response.json()
    
    // Use the data we got back
    return data
  } catch (error) {
    // If the letter gets lost in the mail
    console.error('Oops, something went wrong!', error)
  }
}
```

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ All 4 question types working
2. ✅ Voice interaction functional
3. ✅ LLM grading accurate
4. ✅ Clean, simple UI for kids
5. ✅ Complete exam flow (start → questions → results)
6. ✅ Windows .exe deployment ready

## Risk Assessment

- **Voice recording complexity**: High
- **LLM API reliability**: Low, the user has experience about it
- **Cross-platform deployment**: Medium, but PyInstaller works well
- **Frontend learning**: High, though Vue.js is very beginner-friendly, the user is a total beginner. The user is highly concerned about it.

## Windows Deployment Strategy

### Packaging Steps

1. Build Vue.js frontend to static files
2. Use PyInstaller to package FastAPI + static files
3. Test on Windows target machine
4. Create simple installer if needed

### Development Workflow

- Linux development environment
- Regular testing of cross-platform compatibility
- Final Windows build using PyInstaller with Wine or CI/CD

## Teaching Philosophy: Zero-Prior-Knowledge Approach

### What This Means

- **No assumptions**: I won't assume you know any frontend-related concepts
- **Ultra-specific**: Every line of code will be explained in detail
- **Analogies first**: Complex concepts explained with simple analogies
- **Visual thinking**: Code as building blocks, not abstract text
- **Step-by-step**: One tiny concept at a time, no jumping ahead
- **Introduce-first**: Whenever a new concept is involved, introduce it first

### How I should Teach

1. **Show the user the code** (the what)
2. **Explain what it does** (the why)
3. **Break it down piece by piece** (the how)
4. **Answer any questions** (the clarification)

### The user's Job

- **Stop me immediately** if anything doesn't make sense
- **Ask "why"** for everything - there are no stupid questions
- **Experiment** - change things and see what happens
- **Take your time** - learning isn't a race

## Engineering Style

- No over engineering, even dumb implementation is better than over engineering.

- Always ask the user to start or restart the server.
- Don't ever return mock data. If there's an error, let it expose naturally instead of pretending that everything is working all right.
- Always check API_DOCUMENTATION.md when implementing frontend services.

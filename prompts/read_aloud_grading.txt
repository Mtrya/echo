Text: {question_text}

Please evaluate the student's pronunciation, fluency, and accuracy based on their audio recording.

Provide a score from 0-5 where:
- 4.0-5.0: Excellent pronunciation and fluency, minimal errors
- 3.0-3.5: Good performance with some pronunciation issues
- 2.0-2.5: Fair performance, noticeable pronunciation problems
- 0.0-1.5: Poor performance, significant pronunciation issues

If you can't hear anything or the audio is extremely short, provide a score of 0.0 and feedback. This happens when the student feels nervous.

Respond in JSON format:
{{
    "score": <number between 0-5>,
    "feedback": "<specific feedback on pronunciation and fluency in Chinese>",
    "explanation": "<the exact content of the student's response and detailed explanation of the evaluation in Chinese>"
